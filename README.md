# Anatomical Pretraining for Skeletal Lesion Segmentation in Whole-Body MRI

This repository will contain the code and pretrained models for the paper:

**"Learning from Anatomy: Supervised Anatomical Pretraining (SAP) for Enhanced Metastatic Bone Disease Segmentation in Whole-Body MRI"**  


## ðŸš§ Under Construction

The code and models will be made publicly available upon acceptance of the paper.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project introduces a pretraining framework tailored for whole-body MRI with application to metastatic bone disease detection and segmentation.

## ðŸ”œ Coming Soon

- [ ] Training and inference scripts  
- [ ] Pretrained model weights  
- [ ] Data preparation tools  
- [ ] Example evaluation code  

## ðŸ“„ License

This repository will be released under an open-source license following acceptance.
